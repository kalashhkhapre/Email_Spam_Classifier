Subject: ðŸ’– I Think I Love You Alreadyâ€¦

Hi sweetie,
I saw your profile and felt an instant connection. I just knew I had to write to you. Iâ€™m a widowed nurse living in Canada, looking for something real. Iâ€™m lonely and tired of fake people. Letâ€™s build something beautiful together. I need someone to trust.
But I have a little problem â€“ my phone broke and I need $100 for a new one so we can video call. If you believe in fate like I do, please help me.
Waiting for you,
Jessica ðŸ¥º
