Subject: Letâ€™s Plan That Ladakh Trip Already ðŸ˜‚

Brooo,
Weâ€™ve been talking about this trip forever and havenâ€™t moved a muscle. Enough is enough â€” letâ€™s do it in June after the finals. I checked flights and hotels, and itâ€™s not that expensive if we book now. Letâ€™s sit down this weekend and plan it for real. Iâ€™ll make a Google Sheet for budget and itinerary. Bring the vibes, Iâ€™ll bring the tea.
Talk soon,
Varun
